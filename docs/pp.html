            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes how MemeCurrencyBot, Project Obsidian Anti-Cheat,
                and related systems (collectively, the "Service") process information within
                the r/memeexchangecommunism ecosystem.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
            <p>
                For the purposes of the UK GDPR, EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
                and applicable data protection legislation, the operator of the Service acts
                as the data controller for data processed within this ecosystem.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Categories of Data Processed</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Reddit usernames and publicly available profile information</li>
                <li>Post, comment, and engagement metrics</li>
                <li>Internal currency balances and transaction records</li>
                <li>Security, integrity, and enforcement logs</li>
                <li>Behavioural and transactional metadata necessary for fraud prevention</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Lawful Basis for Processing (UK & EU GDPR)</h2>
            <p>Processing is carried out under one or more of the following lawful bases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Legitimate Interests (Article 6(1)(f)) – operating, securing, and protecting the community economy</li>
                <li>Performance of a service requested by users</li>
                <li>Compliance with legal obligations where applicable</li>
                <li>User consent where legally required</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The legitimate interests pursued include fraud detection, abuse prevention,
                system integrity, enforcement of community rules, and protection of participants.
                These interests are balanced against user rights and freedoms.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Anti-Abuse Monitoring (Project Obsidian)</h2>
            <p>
                Project Obsidian Anti-Cheat performs automated and manual analysis of
                system interactions, transaction patterns, engagement behaviour, and
                related metadata to detect abuse, manipulation, automation misuse,
                or rule violations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Such monitoring is strictly necessary to maintain system security,
                prevent fraud, protect users, and preserve fairness within the
                internal economy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Relevant information may be stored for auditing, investigation,
                evidentiary purposes, and human review. Automated decisions may
                result in balance adjustments, warnings, temporary restrictions,
                or permanent bans where justified.
            </p>

            <p>
                Users may request review of significant automated decisions.
            </p>

            <p>
